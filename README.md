## Omnibus

### Description

Iâ€™m working on a social research project for the prediction of bus travel times for developing areas (non-GPS) via periodic crowdsourcing data. The lack of information of Google Transit Live and the highly confusing schedules are definitely a problem for most cities and my goal is to provide a low-internet-usage solution using crowd-sourced data from passengers.
